# Goggles Abuser

When this project was made there was a "Goggles" bookmarklet that overlaid a collaborative drawing interface over a URL.
The bookmarklet would send API requests to add lines with colors at certain coordinate offsets on the page.

# Running
compile and run, sln is made for VS2010 and I think it is based on .NET 4
